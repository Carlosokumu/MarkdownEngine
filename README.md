# MarkdownEngine
An application that takes in Markdown and outputs HTML, LaTeX

**Background**

Write an application that takes in Markdown and outputs HTML, LaTeX, or any other standard document format based on the input. It is not necessary that the entire syntax of Markdown be implemented, but of course the closer it is to the entire the better the work will appear. But elegance is the greatest desideratum.


## Setting Up
To get started locally:
  - Clone the Repository
  - Open it Using android Studio 3.0 or later
  
## Home Screen
This is home screen where initially there is no markdown added yet.The User is required to tap the add button to add one.

## Adding Markdown
After the User taps on the add button,the add screen is displayed.To enhance UX,there's a sample markdown where the user can edit and know where to start.

There is an improvised EditText that supports common Markdown Syntax like Headers.
